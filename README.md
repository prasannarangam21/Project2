### Technologies used:
*  We plan on pulling the data set in directly with D3.csv (Js and D3)
*  Leaflet and Plotly

### Featured Visualizations:
*  Interactive choropleth map with hover – by city and suicide number
*  Line chart – number of suicides by age
*  Bar chart – Top 10 countries by number of suicides
*  Pie chart – Male vs Female suicide rate
*  Scatter plot – check for correlation between GDP and number of suicides
*  Scatter plot – Y- axis – beginning year of dataset, X-axis – ending year of our dataset

### Reason for choosing the topic: In light of the recent global pandemic, a lot of awareness has been brought to mental health. Although we do not have the most recent data(2020), this invoked our interest in suicide rates by country.
